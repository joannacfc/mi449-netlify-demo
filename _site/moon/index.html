        <h2 class="description">Celestial bodies refer to natural objects in space, such as planets, stars, moons, and other astronomical entities. Earth, our home planet, is part of the solar system and orbits around the Sun. The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, revolves around our planet. Earth-Moon navigation involves the study and understanding of the gravitational interactions between Earth and the Moon, influencing their orbits and the dynamics of celestial bodies in space.</h2>
